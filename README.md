# Comparison of IndoNLU and IndoLEM pre-trained models for Stock News Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis - KOTA405-2019

### Description
Research in analyzing comparison of IndoNLU and IndoLEM pre-trained models (both IndoBERT or monolingual BERT for indonesian language) for Stock News Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis. 
Supporting Material Online (SMOL) is a website application developed using CodeIgnitier Web Framework and MySQL as the database. SMOL developed to manage the inventory of supporting material goods which includes the process of checking whether the goods match the specifications. The previous application still used paper or word documents so that the data was not well integrated and there was no guarding when the material could be used or not. From these problems, the SMOL application was made to solve these problems.

### Technology
- BERT, IndoBERT (IndoNLU and IndoLEM)
- Pyhthon (Anaconda, Jupyter Notebook)
- Library (Pandas, ...)

----
### Experiment
- 
- Developed Model for both IndoBERT model (NLU and LEM) using hyperparameter as suggested from previous research.
- Running Grid Search for both IndoBERT model using hyperparameter space as show below (18 x 2 iteration training model).
- Added Expertiment on Multi Lingual BERT (mBERT) using suggested hyperparameter and best hyperparameter from gridsearch.
- Analytics Comparison from the result base on confussion matrixs and time usage between IndoBERT (NLU and LEM) and mBERT with IndoBERT.
